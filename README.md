# Baseball-Queries-With-Rag

by Anthony Micco

## Project Layout
- [Backend](https://github.com/Ajmicco18/Sports-Memorbilia-Store/blob/main/sports-store-api/README.md): Used a FastAPI backend with Python, MongoDB, and OpenAI API's to implement the backend.
- [Baseball-Queries-App](https://github.com/Ajmicco18/baseball-queries-with-rag/blob/main/baseball-queries-app/README.md): Used a React Vite framework to develop the frontend. 

## Baseball Queries With RAG Backend
- I used the FastAPI framework for the API because it was straightforward to use with Python and had detailed documentation. It also seamlessly integrated with MongoDB, which is what I used for the database. Since I was implementing a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) model, MongoDB was an easy choice because of its ability to store vector search indexes which is essential for RAG. 


## Baseball Queries App

- I used the Vite framework to create the frontend for the Baseball Queries App frontend because I have worked with Vite before and I was 
familiar and comfortable working with it. It also allowed me to use Material UI's component library which I used to design my application.
